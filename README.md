# StarCraft II Bots

This repository contains two bots built with the [python-sc2](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2) framework for Blizzard's real-time strategy game [StarCraft II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Wings_of_Liberty). Both bots are rule-based and built for a short course tought to international relations students, [Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy](https://github.com/SAIS-S2S-Technology/Roadmap/blob/master/CAPS/CAPS_course_website.md). 

Although the bots eschew the learning capabilities integrated into the more advanced [pysc2](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) framework, they hold interesting lessons for thinking about how autonomous agents might interact with a complex environment and how humans developing the agents can control and predict their performance. The goal of the short course, which was taught at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Fall 2018, was for students without a background in computer science, but who might one day grapple with autonomous agents deployed among humans, to think critically about how these agents challenge their understanding of policy and strategy.
