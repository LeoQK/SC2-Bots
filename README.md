# StarCraft II Bots

This repository contains two bots built with the [python-sc2](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2) framework for the real-time strategy game StarCraft II. Both bots are rule-based and built for a short course tought to international relations students, [Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy](https://github.com/SAIS-S2S-Technology/Roadmap/blob/master/CAPS/CAPS_course_website.md). Although the bots eschew the learning capabilities integrated into the more advanced [pysc2](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) framework, they hold interesting lessons for thinking about how autonomous agents might interact with a complex environment and how humans developing the agents can control and predict their performance.
