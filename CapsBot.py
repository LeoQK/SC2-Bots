""" 
Terran bot that stays on 1 base, builds 2 barracks and 1 factory
Pushes into enemy base with min 21 marines and 4 cyclones
Reinforces first push continously so long as min 16 marines and 2 cyclones are alive
First push takes place around 5:30 minute mark
Generally defeats hard AI in TvT, TvP and TvZ lineups
Bot made by Leo Klenner for CAPS workshop to explain rule-based agents
